# Data
Data from CIMMYTâ€™s Global Wheat Program. It contains information on 599 wheat lines whose grain
yield was evaluated in four environments (E1, low rainfall and
irrigated; E2, high rainfall; E3, low rainfall and high temperature;
and E4, low humidity and hot). Data is available for download in R-package 'BGLR' (Perez and de los Campos, 2014).
